Gather atmospheric data to prove theory on conductivity of metals in the ground

Some days when out metal detecting on the same ground, we find very little other than Lead, whilst there is still the chance that we are not finding anything because there is nothing there.
A visit to the same field on another day produces a wide variety of items.
It has been discussed that it could be down to atmospherics interfering with the Metal detector or minerals in the earth that limit the conductivity of various metal types.

I would like to create a form that gathers data from various web based weather sources, including pressue, humidity, precipitation, moonphase and tempreture for a given location

The form will also allow for a drop down of LEAD or NORMAL to give a brief description of finds that day.
A time allocation for what time of day metal detecting occured

This information will then be exported to a table alllowing any corrolation between atmospherics and finds.
